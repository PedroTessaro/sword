# The whole suite at several pool sizes, compared. A program's answer is not
# supposed to depend on how many threads ran it, and this is the check that it
# does not: every runnable test is compiled once and run at each count, and has
# to exit the same way and print the same bytes every time. A test that reports
# a clock or the scheduler's own counters says so with
# `// output-varies: <why>` and is held to its exit status alone.
#
# The standard library's tests run at each count too; they print their own
# timings, so there it is the verdict that has to agree.
#
#   SWORD_COUNTS  the pool sizes to try   (default: 1 2 3 4 8 16)
#   SWORD_ROUNDS  runs at each size       (default: 1)
