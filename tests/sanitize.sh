#
# Builds the runtime again under a sanitizer, links each test program against
# that copy, runs it, and holds it to the exit status its first comment
# declares. `address` is AddressSanitizer with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and
# goes over every test that runs; `thread` is ThreadSanitizer over the tests
# where tasks meet. Name tests to run only those.
#
# The runtime tells both sanitizers about every stack switch, so a report here
# is about the program, not about fibers confusing the tool.
