# Why Sword

Sword is for writing servers: thousands of connections, memory you decide about,
and a compiler that refuses programs where two tasks can touch the same thing at
the same time.

It is young. There is no package ecosystem, the standard library is what there is,
and nothing here has been through a decade of production. If that rules it out for
you, it rules it out — the rest of this page is about what the design actually buys,
and [what it does not](#what-you-give-up), so you can decide rather than guess.

## The one idea

Everything a task can reach is on the line that starts it, and a task cannot
outlive the block that started it.

```sword
scope {
    for off, part in dst.chunks(8) {
        spawn square(src[off..off+part.len], part)
    }
}
```

`spawn` takes a call and nothing else. `scope`'s closing brace is the join. Those
two rules together mean the compiler can see, at the `spawn`, every piece of memory
the new task will ever touch — so it can compare them. Two tasks writing the same
slice is a compile error. Eight tasks writing eight pieces of one array is fine,
because `chunks` hands out pieces that provably do not overlap.

That is the whole trade, and it is worth being clear about both halves:

**What it buys.** No data races, checked at compile time, with no ownership
annotations and no lifetimes to write. And because a task cannot outlive its
`scope`, it can borrow memory from the stack of the function that started it — the
example above lends two slices of a stack arena to eight tasks and allocates nothing
per task.

**What it costs.** No closures, so a callback that needs state is an interface
instead. No detached tasks: you cannot start work and walk away from it. Long-lived
shared state needs `shared[T]`, which is a lock, rather than fine-grained ownership.

And one limit worth knowing before you trust it: the checker compares accesses by
the binding they come from, so memory with no name behind it — a slice returned
straight out of a call and handed to a task without being bound to anything — is not
tracked. `atomic[T]` and `shared[T]` are the two deliberate exits, and both are safe
because there is no way to reach the value except through them.

Rust prevents the same class of bug with far more reach — across arbitrary
lifetimes, not just within a scope — and charges you a borrow checker for it. Go
does not prevent it at all: the race detector is a runtime tool, it only sees races
that actually happen while it is watching, and you have to remember to turn it on.
Sword takes most of the guarantee for a fraction of the machinery by giving up
open-ended task lifetimes. Whether that is a good deal depends entirely on whether
your tasks want to be open-ended. In a server, they usually do not: a connection
begins, is served, and ends.

## A task is an ordinary function

There is no `async`. A task is a function, and any function can wait:

```sword
func handle(c net.Conn) !void {
    mut buf := [1024]u8{}
    n := try c.Read(buf[..])   // the task stops here; the thread does not
    try c.Write(buf[0..n])
}
```

`handle` is callable directly and spawnable, and nothing in its type says which. In
Rust, `async fn` is a different kind of function: it returns a future, it can only
be awaited from another `async fn`, and the split runs all the way down through
every library you use — plus `Pin`, `Send`, `Sync` and a choice of executor. In
JavaScript and Python the same split exists under different names. Go does not have
it either, and this is one of the reasons Go is pleasant to write servers in.

The cost of avoiding it is that each task needs its own stack. Sword reserves a
megabyte per task and commits the pages a task actually touches, which measured on a
real server is about 33 KiB for an idle keep-alive connection. The ceiling that
follows is honest to state: each stack needs a guard page, the kernel counts a
protected range as a mapping, and Linux allows around sixty-five thousand of them —
so tens of thousands of concurrent tasks, not millions. An async runtime with
heap-allocated state machines goes further on the same memory. If you need a million
idle connections on one box, that is a real argument against this design.

Measured, on ten cores, with keep-alive:

| | |
|---|---|
| 4000 concurrent connections | 84 000 requests/second, 12 threads |
| 1000 concurrent connections | 146 000 requests/second, 34 MiB |
| 2000 idle connections | 65 MiB — 33 KiB each |
| 20 000 tasks, 16 KiB touched each | 338 MiB, 11 threads |

The waiting is uniform, which matters more than the throughput number. A socket
read, a sleep, a TLS handshake, a file read and a name lookup all put the *task*
down and leave the thread to somebody else. Files and name lookups cannot be
polled, so they go to a small pool of threads kept for exactly that: forty
concurrent file reads cost ten workers and ten pool threads, not forty threads.

## Nothing allocates behind your back

A function that touches the heap takes an allocator. There are no exceptions, not
even in the standard library:

```sword
func ReadAll(path string, mut a mem.Allocator) ![]u8
func TrimSpace(s string) string              // cannot allocate: nowhere to do it from
```

Reading a signature tells you whether it can allocate. That is not a style rule —
it is the only way to allocate, so it cannot drift. In practice it means an HTTP
handler gets a 16 KiB arena on its own task's stack, serves the request out of it,
and the arena goes away when the task does. No GC pauses to tune, no allocator to
instrument, no surprise in the middle of a hot path.

It is also why two strings do not join with `+`. The joined string has to live
somewhere, so `strings.Concat` takes the allocator it goes in; two constants join
with `+` at compile time, where nothing is allocated at all.

Go's allocation is invisible and its GC is the price — a very well-built price,
but one you cannot opt out of. C gives you `malloc` and no discipline about it.
Rust's `Vec` and `String` allocate from a global allocator by default, and
threading a custom one through a program is still awkward.

## The same answer, however many threads

Parallel code usually answers a little differently from one run to the next. Add
up a million doubles on four threads and on sixteen and the last digits differ,
because the pieces are combined in whatever order they finish and floating-point
addition cares about order. It is rarely a bug anybody can reproduce, which is
exactly what makes it expensive.

In Sword that difference does not exist, and the compiler checks that it does
not:

```sword
det func total(xs []f64) f64 {
    mut sum := num.NewExact()
    parallel for i in 0..xs.len reduce(num.MergeExact: sum) {
        sum.Add(xs[i])
    }
    return sum.Value()
}
```

`det` is a claim that what a function answers depends on its arguments and on
nothing else — not on the number of threads, not on the order they ran in, not
on the clock, not on where anything landed in memory. The work is still spread
over every core. What is fixed is how it is cut, which depends on the length
alone, and the order the pieces are put back together in, which is the order
they were cut. More threads make it finish sooner; they never change what it
answers.

What takes the claim away is short: an atomic, a lock, the clock or anything
else outside the language, an address read as a number, and a channel that two
tasks send on at once. What does *not* take it away is the point — a `scope`
full of tasks, a `parallel for`, and a pipeline of tasks joined by channels,
each with one sender and one receiver, which Kahn showed in 1974 computes the
same thing whichever task runs when. Every function is analysed whether it says
`det` or not; writing the word asks to be told, with the chain of calls that
lost it, when it no longer holds.

The standard library carries it the rest of the way:

- **Random numbers** (`std/rand`) where the i-th number depends on the seed and
  i, so iteration 5000 of a parallel loop draws the same numbers wherever it
  runs.
- **Parallel operations** (`std/par`) that keep the rule: a prefix sum, a filter
  that keeps the original order, the position of the smallest element with ties
  going to the first, and a stable sort.
- **Mathematics** (`std/num`) that gives the same bits on every machine.
  `Sin`, `Cos`, `Exp` and `Log` are within one unit in the last place, and `Sqrt`
  is the nearest double; they use only operations every processor rounds alike,
  and they printed identical bits on macOS and Linux, arm64 and x86-64, over 340
  000 arguments. The C library is not the same program everywhere — macOS's and
  glibc's disagreed on 9 of about 240 000 of those arguments — and a det
  function could not call it anyway.
- **An exact sum** (`num.Exact`) that rounds once, at the end, so a parallel sum
  is not just the same at every thread count but the same double as adding the
  numbers one by one.

It is checked, not claimed: every change runs the whole test suite at 1, 2, 3, 4,
8 and 16 threads, on Linux and on macOS, and requires the same bytes out of
every program each time. What it does not cover is the edge of the program. A
server's clients arrive in the order the world sends them, and `main` and the
network are outside the claim on purpose.

## The order that breaks it, on demand

`det` covers what can be made independent of order. A server cannot be: its
tasks lock, count with atomics and wait on each other, and which one gets there
first is the whole point. The race checker still refuses the data races there.
What it cannot refuse is a mistake in the order itself — two tasks that both read
a counter before either writes it back, two locks taken in opposite orders.
That is legal code which fails only in some interleavings, and on a real machine
that means once in ten thousand runs, rarely while anybody is watching.

`shield test -sim` runs each test on one thread with every scheduling choice
drawn from a seed, once per seed, and when one fails it says which:

```
FAIL  TestLostUpdate under seed 2
     --- FAIL  TestLostUpdate
           got 1, want 2
      reproduce: shield test -sim -seed 2 -run TestLostUpdate ./counter
```

The seed is the whole failure. Run that line and the same interleaving happens
again, as many times as it takes to understand it — a concurrency bug you can
reproduce is an ordinary bug. A deadlock is reported as one instead of hanging.
Time is virtual: when every task is waiting on the clock it jumps to the next
deadline, so a test with a thirty-second timeout, or one that sleeps for an hour,
finishes at once. Any program runs the same way with `SWORD_SIM_SEED` set.

It is the approach FoundationDB made famous for testing a database, here as a
flag on the test runner. What it does not do yet is the network: a test that
opens a socket is skipped under `-sim` until simulated sockets arrive in a later
release.
[Testing](testing.md#simulation) has the details.

## Smaller things that add up

**A failure cannot be ignored.** `!T` cannot be discarded, and its value cannot be
reached until it is handled. Errors are declared with the sentence they say, cost
nothing to raise, and the same name from two packages is one error:

```sword
error Stale = "the cached answer is older than the caller allows"
```

**A mutex has the value inside it.** `shared[T]` can only be reached through
`lock`, so there is no way to touch the data without holding the lock — the same
idea as Rust's `Mutex<T>`, and the opposite of a `sync.Mutex` sitting next to the
field it is supposed to protect.

**A task cannot be forgotten.** A goroutine that nobody is waiting for is a leak
Go cannot see. A Sword task is joined by the closing brace of its `scope`, so that
shape does not exist: a task that never finishes blocks the join instead, which you
find out about immediately rather than through a memory graph three weeks later.

**The whole thing is small enough to read.** The compiler is about 11 400 lines of
C++, the runtime 4 500, the language server 1 300, and the standard library 8 100
lines of Sword with no hidden compiler primitives behind it. For a language you are
going to depend on, being able to read all of it in a weekend is worth something.

**It is tested where it runs.** Every change is built and tested on Linux and on
macOS, with TLS and without, before it can be merged; a program's standard
library, networking and scheduler are the same code on both, TCP and UDP, IPv4
and IPv6.

**The compiler is the language server.** `swordls` links the same lexer, parser and
checker as `shield` and calls the same `check()`. The colouring knows a type from a
function because it comes from the symbol table, not from a regular expression, and
a diagnostic in the editor is the diagnostic the compiler gives.

## Against each one in particular

**Go.** The same task model, and Go does it with a decade of polish, a real
ecosystem and the best tooling in the business. Sword differs in five ways that
matter: no garbage collector and no hidden allocation, races caught at compile time
rather than sometimes at run time, tasks that cannot leak, parallel code whose
answer does not depend on the machine it ran on, and tests that replay the
interleaving that failed. If you want a
service written this afternoon with libraries for everything, write Go. If you want
to know where every byte went and have the compiler refuse your races, that is what
this is for.

**Rust.** Stronger guarantees than Sword gives — use-after-free, data races, across
any lifetime, not just inside a scope — and an ecosystem to match. The price is the
borrow checker and, for servers, the async split described above. Sword is a much
smaller language to hold in your head, and its concurrency reads like straight-line
code. If you need to prove more than "no races inside this scope", use Rust; it is
the better tool and it is not close.

**C++ with OpenMP or TBB.** The fastest way to spread a loop over cores today,
and TBB even has a reduction that answers the same on any number of threads. But
that promise covers one call: nothing checks what the rest of the function does,
and one atomic counter or one library call that reads the clock takes it away
without a word. Sword makes the same promise about a whole function, and the
compiler says which line broke it.

**C.** Every platform, every library, and an ABI everything speaks — Sword links
against C for exactly that reason. What it adds on top: slices that know their
length and are checked, errors that cannot be ignored, no implicit allocation but
arenas and allocators as ordinary values, tasks with a scheduler, and a compiler
that refuses the concurrency bug you would otherwise find in production. What C
keeps is everything else.

## What you give up

Said plainly, because a page like this is worthless otherwise:

- **No ecosystem.** No package manager, no third-party libraries. The standard
  library is `std/mem`, `std/io`, `std/fmt`, `std/bytes`, `std/strings`,
  `std/unicode`, `std/collections`, `std/json`, `std/crypto`, `std/num`,
  `std/rand`, `std/par`, `std/os`, `std/fs`, `std/process`, `std/time`,
  `std/runtime`, `std/net`, `std/tls`, `std/http`, `std/chan` and `std/testing`.
  That is the list.
- **Not memory-safe in Rust's sense.** Sword stops data races, stops a task from
  outliving the memory it borrowed, and refuses a function that hands back its own
  frame. It does not stop you from freeing something and reading it afterwards:
  that would take the ownership machinery this language deliberately does not have.
  Bounds and integer overflow are checked in the default build mode, `mem.Watch`
  and `mem.NewWatched` make released memory read as obviously wrong rather than
  plausible, and `shield test` turns the first of those on for you — but the
  discipline is yours. [The tour says what that discipline
  is](tour.md#memory-that-has-gone-away).
- **No closures.** Function values carry no captured state, by design — it is part
  of what makes `spawn` checkable. State goes in an interface.
- **Tens of thousands of tasks, not millions.** A stack each, and the kernel counts
  the mappings.
- **Young everywhere it counts.** TLS is a thin layer over OpenSSL rather than
  something audited. The simulator does not simulate the network yet. There is
  no Windows support. The HTTP client keeps one
  connection rather than a pool. No `io_uring`. No formal anything.
- **It is one person's language.** Decisions were made once, by one person, and
  some of them will turn out wrong.

## When not to use it

If you need a library that already exists, use the language that has it. If you need
guarantees beyond races and scopes, use Rust. If you need to run on a platform
nobody has tried, use C. If you are shipping something to customers next month, use
what you already know.

Use this if you are writing a server, you care where your memory goes, and you would
rather the compiler argue with you now than debug a race at three in the morning.
